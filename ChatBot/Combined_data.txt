Mental Health - 
Mental Health is more than just being free from issues such as anxiety and depression. It's about being happy, self-confident, self-aware, and resilient. Looking after your mental health is just as important as caring for your physical health. People who are mentally healthy are in control of their emotions and behavior. They're able to handle life's inevitable challenges, build strong relationships, and lead productive, fulfilling lives. They bounce back when bad things happen and can manage stress without falling apart. But, building mental health requires effort, just like physical health. None the less, improving your mental health can be a rewarding experience, benefiting all aspects of your life, including boosting your mood, building resilience, and adding to your overall enjoyment of life.

Common Challenges
Anger, anxiety, disgust, excitement, fear, happiness, joy and sadness, to name a few are a few emotional expressions which commonly get affected during mental health challenges. Emotional changes can be normal, temporary responses to events. Emotional changes can also be disproportionate, extreme, persistent or unstable emotional reactions indicating an underlying disorder.

Anxiety

Anxiety is a normal emotional and physiological response to feeling threatened. People differ as to how vulnerable they feel in different situations: this can be influenced by past experiences as well as by the beliefs and attitudes they hold about these situations.

Loneliness

It is a cliche that we can feel lonely - even particularly lonely - in a crowd. Unfortunately it is one that is only too true and all too common at university. Here, surrounded by people of a similar age and, supposedly, with lots in common we can nevertheless feel wretchedly isolated and awkward. This is made worse by the sight of others who seem perfectly at ease, are rapidly making friends and are becoming embedded in groups from which you feel excluded or only tolerated on the margins.Feelings of Loneliness Occur to Us All - Sometimes we are thrown into that sense of uniqueness and the awareness that no-one can ever fully know and understand us. In fact, occasionally we may feel that we do not even understand ourselves! This is because we are constantly changing in response to the situations and relationships that we develop. We have to accept that feeling lonely is an occasional price we pay for being human. However, an ongoing sense of deep loneliness can bring on feelings of despair and depression that indicate a need to get help.

Procrastination

The avoidance of doing a task which needs to be done - postponing until tomorrow what can be done today. Procrastination not only affects a person's work, but also commonly involves feelings such as guilt, inadequacy, self-disgust, stress and depression. Often we try to disguise our avoidance by being very busy doing things that may be interesting, and even useful, but don't contribute towards the main goal - even doing something we normally hate - rather than writing, for example, just before an essay deadline!

Exam Stress

Do you sweat as the date of your examination approaches? Is your concern or worry, about how the next few days will be as exams approach, causing you to under-perform?Well then you might be experiencing what is reffered to as Examination Stress.Examination Stress is an uneasiness or apprehension experienced before, during, or after an examination. It is very common among college and university students. But some students find that this interferes with their learning to such an extent that it can reduce the efficiency of performance so that results emerge lower than they should, and when anxiety begins to affect exam performance it has become a problem.

Home Sickness

Many students coming to college, and maybe leaving home for the first time, feel homesick. Even those who didn't ever expect to be hit by homesickness can suddenly find themselves missing the familiarity of home and friends, and don't know quite how to cope with the resulting emotions. This is entirely normal and passes, usually in the first term, and often within the first few weeks.It is really important to realize that you are not the only one feeling homesick and that it doesn't in any way mean you are inadequate. Suddenly, you find that, instead of being a central person in a small unit with plenty of peripheral activities and friends, you have become an anonymous member of a four thousand plus community where you know no-one. Understandably you feel shaken and lonely and you long for the secure and the familiar. Sometimes the emotions are completely overwhelming.

Relationship

Relationship or marital problems come in all shapes and sizes. So, If you're feeling distraught, worn out or desperate for help then please remember that you are not alone, and you are now in the right place.As a qualified and experienced couple counsellor I have been with many individuals and couples who have experienced these feelings. My expert knowledge has allowed me to help them to understand how and why they are struggling. They learned how to deal with their problems, solve them and move forward.

Conflicts

Coming to one of the best engineering institutes just after your schooling can be exhilarating, challenging and sometimes unsettling. For most of you it's probably the first time you are going away from your home and your family to face the world outside. It may take few days to adjust with the entirely new environment here, including the academics, food, interaction with seniors and most importantly with your batch-mates. As an undergraduate student, most of you will be allotted a two-seater room for first couple of years. So it becomes really significant how you go on with your friends especially your room-mate.It may happen that initially you don't feel comfortable with your friends, especially your room-mate, due to various reasons like language problem, different lifestyle or anything of that sort. Don't worry, as it is quite natural in the beginning. But you have to understand that you all are living here in a common fraternity and things will go better eventually as you start understanding your partner. It would be unfair to expect anyone to change their ways to suit you without you doing the same. The initial days requires a bit of tolerance from your side and you need to adjust. Even if things don't work out, it's much easier to unravel the problem by discussing it with your partner or with your friends rather than keeping it to yourself and unnecessarily getting tensed and ruining your health. You are mature enough to decide your preferences and conflict with others is definitely not one of them. Even then if you find it difficult, then, Counselling Service is always here to help you, to guide you. Do not hesitate to take proper guidance rather than indulging in trivial issues like conflict with others. Remember, you are here because you have the ability to grow and learn. Learning to work in a group and adapt to changing environment is one of the thing IITK would teach you. We are sure that you will make your parents and this institute proud.


Individual Sessions - You can come for a one-on-one counselling session for any issue that might be troubling you. Counselling provides a confidential environment where you can express yourself without being judged and explore your options in a supportive growth-oriented manner. Our counsellors will listen unconditionally, help you in reaching better understanding of yourself and your challenges, explore own choices, thereby enabling you to overcome your problems. The Counselling Sessions are free and completely confidential.
Group Therapy - Counselling Service organizes group therapy sessions on a regular interval where people facing similar challenges meet along with a counselor. Group therapy requires people to be mutually respectful and maintain confidentiality. The major advantage of group sessions is that it provides a platform to share your experiences of the problems and learn from other's experiences how they have been managing their problems, while being guided by the counselor towards improved ways of functioning and being.

ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Academic Help - IIT Kanpur is a premier academic institution and so, providing academic help forms an integral part of the work undertaken by the Institute Counselling Service. The ICS monitors the academic performance of students who are not able to meet their prescribed academic requirements. If you are facing any difficulty, you can always approach us for individual mentoring. For first year courses, you can also attend the remedial classes which are regularly conducted at the institute and hall level to help clarify doubts and concepts.
Study Tips - Students often, either because of personal reasons or involvement in extra curricular activities or lack of motiviation, do not want to gear up too early, but let us tell you that leaving preparation for too late is an excellent recipe for stress. Regularly attending the classes and being in touch with the course material is a good idea. It not only helps you prepare better for the exams but also keeps you interested in the course. - 
Know Yourself - 
Different students have different ways of studying. Some are able to perform and understand better by covering current subjects in small amounts on a regular basis in accordance with class, while some others find it convenient to study in bulk say at the end of the week or so. You should try figure out which way suits you better. In case you can not come to a conclusion, we suggest you to follow the first approach of studying in small amounts on a regular basis.
Identify Best Time for Studying: Everyone has high and low periods of attention and concentration. Figure out are you a morning person or a night person. Use your power times to study and the down times for routines.
Write down what you have to do, when and then prioritize. Maintaining a schedule can make you feel more in control.
Identify the place of study that suites you most, avoiding distractions, be it the library or the comfort of your room.
You should constantly motivate yourself
Reward yourself when you have achieved some goal.
Try not to overburden yourself by unnecessarily comparing yourself with others. - 
Improving Concentration - Take regular, short breaks when you are working - for example, some students find it better to study for an hour or so and then relax for 10 mins. This helps to concentrate for longer. Rather than studying throughout the night in library without enough concentration, itâs better to focus your attention and study effectively for a shorter period of time.If you are finding it very difficult to concentrate, start off by setting yourself a small, manageable goal. When you have achieved this, give yourself some reward. Keep repeating this process. As you achieve your goals, gradually increase what you set out to do. In this way you can train yourself to concentrate more effectively. - Improving Study Habits - Improving the study habits also help in concentrating better. Here are a few tips: -  Make notes as you read. And list the important points that can be reviewed later.
 Speak out loud.
 Mix topics frequently. Mix easy and difficult topics, and interesting and dull topics.
 Seek help from the seniors who had already done that course, you can learn from their experience and their mistakes.
 Discuss your doubts with your friends, this will help you in better understanding the topic.
If you still have doubts feel free to approach your instructor/tutor. Just mail them and ask for some suitable time to meet them. - 
Self Confidence - 
 Everyone in this class is smarter and faster than I am.
 I always mess up on quizzes.
 If I don't do well on this exam, then I'll get an F in the course.
 This is the worst course. - 
Become aware of what you say to yourself. Try writing your negative thoughts and then disputing each one with a positive statement like Even if I am afraid, I will do everything I can to overcome any obstacle in order to achieve my goals Encourage yourself, as you would have done to a friend. Repeating your positive statements to yourself will help reprogram your mind for success instead of for failure. In case you still find it difficult to get rid of these thoughts or feelings please feel free to contact our counsellors who might be able to help you better.
Remedial Classes - We aim to try and solve problems faced by academically weaker students to help them cope with the academic system of the institute.
Remedial classes are conducted and one to one mentoring is offered for these students. Remedial classes are conducted at regular intervals and on demand near quizzes/exams at institute level as well as hall level for 1st
year and 2nd year courses. The aim of these classes, rather than to provide a parallel tutoring system, is to cover topics at a ground
level so as to clear concepts and provide motivation for the topics being studied. These classes are held regularly during whole semester
and help the student to perform better in their exams. Structure of classes are designed such that basic of the course contents can be
easily understood. These classes are further sub-categorized into three :
1. Institute level Remedial classes 2. Hall Level Remedial Classes 3.One to One mentoring. 
Institute Remedial Classes

Institute level Remedial classes are organized by the Institute Counselling Service in order to provide help in understanding courses and clearing doubts, if any. The main aim for organizing these classes are to clear common doubts in the course and to provide a platform for students to strengthen their basics.These classes aren't meant to be substitutes for regular lectures. It is highly recommended not to miss any lecture assuming that a remedial class will be held. Remedial classes do not cover all course content, and are conducted at a very slow pace.

Hall Level Classes

Hall Level Classes are held in the respective halls(hostels). This initiative is taken in the under-graduate Halls of Residence to increase the student-mentor interaction. These classes are generally held a week before exams to help a student to clarify their common doubts and help them in solving tricky numerical problems.

One To One Mentoring

One-to-one mentoring is a means to address academic problems of students at an individual level, especially for those who aren't able to match other students' pace in a class and/or are hesitant to talk about problems that they are facing publicly.

WORKSHOP AND SESSIONS
Sessions
The Institute Counselling Service organizes numerous sessions throughout the academic year aimed at sensitizing the campus community on issues related to mental health, emotional quotient and general well-being, and some fun events. Sessions are also aimed at acquainting students about various internship opportunities, and promoting senior-junior interaction.

Inter-Gyan Session
How to utilize the summers effectively? This is a question which puts a lot of students in a fix. This session addresses all such queries. Seniors from various departments who have had pursued research internships, management internships or core or noncore internships during their summers, illuminate their juniors with the myriad opportunities present out there.
Session on Relationships
The dynamics of relationships amidst which one lives are complex in nature. We aim to help students understand and unwind the complications of these through this session.
Study Techniques Session
Students are focused on improving their study techniques in order to optimize their skill set to the maximum. The session on study techniques is aimed at acquainting students on various studying approaches which can be helpful for them in regularizing their studies and performing better in their examinations.
Time Management Session
One of the most pressing issues in the campus for Undergraduate and Postgraduate students is how to spend time on the right things and in the right places. We try to help students in reaching out to their priorities, obligations and schedule so that they benefit in all areas of life through this session.
Session on Addiction
Aimed at helping the students understand the various forms of addiction and sensitize them on ways to overcome them.

Because You Matter
"Tough times will come in everyone's life. It is important to realize that something good is meant
out of them. The bright side of things- people help you know all this...But only if you reach
out!" Sudhendu reached out. You can too! We want to thank Sudhendu for sharing his experiences
with us and with the community. It takes immense courage to do the same. We hope that this motivates
more people to reach out.

On the face of it people might think one is happy and good and all is going well, but he/she might be
facing a tsunami of emotions in his/her personal life which remains hidden, which makes things and
situations suffocating and very difficult to cope with. It's important for people living with mental
health conditions to know that they are not alone.If you or someone you know is going through a tough
time, talking to someone might sound like a simplistic solution but it really is one of the best
possible things you/they can do. Share your story, it opens people to share theirs. #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek

Events

Orientation
Quoting our alumni, "Orientation is one of the best memories of IITK." The Institute Counselling Service conducted a 11-day long Orientation for the new Freshers batch to help them get acclimatized to campus and bond with their batchmates. It is the largest College Orientation programme in the nation. Students are introduced to Academic Structure, Administrative Structure, Students' Gymkhana, Clubs & Societies and the various opportunities IITK has for its students. Orientation also contains games, wing activities, interactive sessions and a campus tour with the aim to nurture the newly formed bonds among the students. Memories made here stay forever.

Suicide Prevention Day
World Suicide Prevention Day is an awareness day observed on 10 September every year to provide worldwide commitment and action to prevent suicide with various activities worldwide since 2003. IIT Kanpur also organises events every year to raise awareness that suicide is preventable and to decrease stigma regarding suicide. This year the Institute Counselling Service conducted a seminar, which included a talk by the renowned psychiatrist of Kanpur, Dr Kalim Ahmed.

Mental Health day
On the occasion of mental health day, the Institute Counselling Service conducted various inspiring events to bring attention to Mental health wellness. A Mental health awareness talk was organised to have an open interaction of the campus community with the counsellors to share their thoughts and learn about the importance of mental health in a person's life. There were many fun activities for the audience to have fun while learning to take care of their mental health. The session was followed by a movie screening of "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", which portrays the life of a teenager & his struggles with his post-traumatic stress disorder as he goes through his journey in high school.

Hakuna Matata
Every year on Diwali, we organize 'Hakuna Matata'. Since many students celebrate Diwali away from home, we take the initiative of making students feel at "Home away from Home" by conducting various fun-filled activities to engage the students in positive gainful activities and let off steam under Hakuna Matata. This year, the celebration included a Rangoli Competition in collaboration with the Fine Arts Club. Following this, the day ended with students flying Sky Lanterns and decorating the ground with Diyas marking the Festival of lights.

Academic Remedial Classes
Academic Remedial classes, otherwise known as AM Classes, are sessions organised to cover the syllabus of the first year courses and to gear up the students for upcoming exams. These classes are meant to clear any doubts, solve questions and cover the course content concisely and clearly from an exam point of view. These sessions are headed by Academic Mentors who also prepare short notes and discuss questions keeping in mind the past year's question trends.

Run and Walk for a Cause
A 5km Run and Walk event with the theme "Run and Walk for a Cause" was also held for the campus community to spirit up the mental health day and bring the attention of the importance of mental health. The Marathon started at OAT and continued all through the Campus. Goodies, along with energy drinks, were also distributed to the participants.

About SAMVAD - SAMVAD The Institute Counselling Service has started a new initiative towards maintaining good mental health called "Samvad." Under Samvad, we aim to organize various talks, panel discussions and related activities to spread mental health awareness.
[Talk] What is Addiction? - 
Mindfulness for Well Being, Focus and Energy
Dr. Vivek Benegal 
Professor of Psychiatry, 
National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) 
Details
 Addiction can be confusing. Especially when one isn't sure if engagement with some substances or activities is just curiosity, necessity or compulsion.
Such habits can be notorious in the sense of causing more harm than one realizes.
And by the time one does, a lot of harm has already been done to the person, their future, and aspirations.
Counselling Service invited Dr. Vivek Benegal from NIMHANS to help us understand addictive behaviors better so that we are equipped to know how to help ourselves and people we care about while dealing with addictive substances and habits.
[Panel Discussion] Holding on to the Light - 
Details
It is important for us to come together to prevent our friends from taking any untoward step.
We often fail unwittingly, to lend a helping hand in their hour of distress, because more often than not, we are incapable of recognising the symptoms and hence are unable to provide the necessary support. 
It is also crucial for people to realise that they will find help, if only they would seek it.
The aim of the panel discussion, "Holding on to the Light", is to raise awareness about this issue and also to look for possible solutions.
Because, in an inclusive society, suicide prevention is everyone's responsibility.

[Interactive session] From Lost to Found - 
From LOST to FOUND
Counselling Service brings to you "From LOST to FOUND" the first program, underÂ SAMVAD, for this semester.
SAMVADÂ as a mental health initiative recognizes stories and narratives as powerful ways of connecting people through their struggles and their success.
Margaret Atwood said that "In the end, we'll all become stories". However, people who chose to share their stories are also sharing their truths, their light, their courage, and their warmth with whoever might need it. By owning their stories, they are also accepting themselves, celebrating their struggles, owning their failures, and shaping their future.
From LOST to FOUND is bringing stories of people from the community, for the community, with the intentions of building empathetic and nurturing spaces at IITK. Join us for an interactive session to celebrate the struggles of everyday living and contribute to each other's ways of living life with respect, dignity, and courage.Date: 20th January 2020
Time: 6:15 PM
Venue: L-17
Tea will be served at 6 p.m.
The Panelists,
Ms. Rita ShuklaCounsellor,Shreyosi VashishthaCounsellor,Rupesh Chafle,Anurag Dwivedi,
Moderator,Arpita GuptaProject Counsellor, CS,Q&A from Lost to Found
Q. I think I am a good listener. However, when someone expresses an opinion on a situation that is totally contrasting to me - I have this bias that this person is overthinking or thinking wrongly of the situation; and that results in expressing my opinion too - leading to a poor conversation. How do you, as a counselor, practice to keep your bias totally aside?
You bring in a lot of self-awareness with your question.
Counsellors' education and training improve their communication skills and allow them to practice empathy along with maintaining their rationality.
On a general level, learning assertive communication skills might be useful to maintain a good conversation. Using the given communication style, a person can learn to express their thoughts and feeling without coming across as too aggressive or too passive to others.
HowQ. to realize that we're 'worthy' of it? How could one be 'what you want to be' retaining what 'you originally are'?
Being worthy of a meaningful, happy, and satisfying life is the goal of human existence. Things/people/experiences which make you question your worth and your happiness need to be questioned themself.
The second part of the question compares future 'self' with the present 'self'. It relates to the underlying insecurities and fear which any life changes bring about. You can understand it in this way that the "5-year younger you" is not the same as "the present you". In the same way, "the future you" will also be different. Although, you are one person, and what connects them is 'being you.' When you develop an awareness of 'who I am' as a person, then external changes will only be able to bring external effects, and internally it will be the same 'you' who has gone through these changes.
Q.
I have a wingie from a reserved category who has a very low CPI < 4 after the third semester. He is facing Academic Probation. He has lied to his parents about his CPI. He is currently participating in Galaxy(dance). He does not talk with anybody from the wing (from the beginning). What do you think should be done to help him? Do you think it is necessary for the counselling service or the Institute to prevent such people from participating in cultural events as their CPI is low? Or do you think something can be done to do the above-mentioned activities? Please give a realistic response. Your question reflects a lot of concern and good intentions on your part. For your wingie, 1. Academic help can be provided to him through academic mentors or TAs. 2. As per the Institute policy, if a student is in 'Academic Probation' or 'Warning', they can not hold any ' Position Of Responsibility'. 3. If a student does not want to take part in some hall level event/activity but is being forced by seniors or peers, one can inform his Student Guide, counsellor, Head of Counselling Service, DOSA, or Hall warden. He will be exempted from taking part in the event. However, if a person is extremely motivated to take part in some co-curricular activity and is unable to make the balance between academics and co-curricular activities, then he has to work on his 'Time Management' . Attending regular classes and a few hours of self-study may help him.
Q. How do you overcome the feeling of loss of interest in doing basic routine daily life? How do you cope up with the constant thoughts of what shall I do to be happy in a depression period? How to cope with this if the person gets diagnosed with depression with anxiety and panic attacks behavioral problems?Â Losing interest in doing basic routine daily life is signs and symptoms of depression and with the help of psychological intervention, a person can improve their interest in doing things.Â  It is like a process to work on that to develop interest in daily activities in collaboration with the therapist and client. There is no specific way to be happy during a depression period. During that period a person goes through negative automatic thoughts about the self,future and sometimes about the world. So during this time a professional counselor or therapist can help a person to live in a normal way. If a person is diagnosed with depression it's difficult for the person to cope up with the depression, but with the help of medication and psychotherapy and counseling a person with depression can cope up and lead a normal life.
Q. It happens very often to me that I am doing something and my mind is not there. Basically I loose focus and concentration while I know this type of behaviour will cause difficulty to my life, mostly , to my studies. Please suggest something about it.Â Thank you for sharing your problem with us. There can be many 'n' number of variables which are contributing to your problem. It can be boredom or lack of interest in the work or studies or maybe you are finding the subject difficult, also it reflects your mental state, which can also be the reason behind impaired concentration and attention. In my opinion, Mindfulness based therapies will help you in resolving your problem. You are most welcome to Counselling service.
Q. Suppose if you have sought changes thinking for your good.You try doing right things and one after another things keep going on wrong no matter how you try. How should one keep himself/herself emotionally & mentally stable in that case?There are many times in our lives we don't get desired outcomes . Sometimes , introspection helps, sometimes accepting things as they are makes yourself stable.Â  You should work on your coping mechanism and a professional psychologist can also help you with this.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Counselling
What is Counselling?
Counselling is not the same as giving advice. It is quite different from the general opinion held by people. Going for a counselling session in no way indicates that you are helpless or incapable of solving your problems. By talking about your problems or concerns with a counsellor you will deepen your understanding of your problem and develop the means to deal with them. We are happy to talk over any of your problems and with your agreement may refer you to other sources who might be able to help better such as psychiatrists or doctors.
Do I have to pay for Counselling?
All registered undergraduate and postgraduate students can avail the service free of cost. The expenditure involved if you wish to see the psychiatrist is also borne by the service.
How do I contact the Institute Counselling Service team?
You can contact the team members by seeing us in person, making a telephone call or mail-anything you are comfortable with. Click here to see the list of contacts.
What do I say?
It doesn't really matter how you present your problem.You can say whatever you like. Sometimes there is silence, sometimes you might find yourself saying things you had not expected to say. The counsellor will help you explore the matter and will keep referring to you to clarify his/her understanding.
What kind of problems can I talk to a counsellor about?
You can come to us for academic problems, emotional issues, career awareness and financial difficulties. These may include stress related problems, exam anxiety, personal problems and career related queries.
What will the counsellor think of me - will they think badly of me for getting into a mess?
Many of our problems arise just because we are human.We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. No. Counselling is based in the belief that most people naturally strive to make the best use of themselves. When something goes wrong, it is usually because we are pushing ourselves too hard; because we are in a muddle for reasons we don't fully understand or because we are actually are suffering some form of mental distress which is distorting our view of reality. Therefore judging is not helpful or relevant; they need to be supported in finding their own way out of the problem.
How can it be right to be in need of help?
We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. Needing help is a normal part of this process. You could only label it as failure if you had already decided you must succeed entirely on our own - which is not a burden you have to impose on yourself. If you think you've failed, the counsellor might help you see that this is not all there is to it.
Doesn't asking for counselling mean admitting failure?
Paradoxically it can be seen as a matter of strength to ask for counselling. Many people think that they are being strong in not seeking help whereas in fact those who can admit to their difficulties could be considered the strong ones. Asking for counselling often mean you have taken the first difficult step on the road to resolving the problem.
What if I still feel ashamed of my problems?
Counsellors do accept that it is natural to want to appear successful and that most of us feel some shame when we have problems and so don't want to advertise our difficulties. This is one of the reasons we place a great emphasis on confidentiality.
How confidential is counselling?
Strict confidentiality is ensured in the Institute Counselling Service.
If I have had counselling, does it go on my record?
If a student approaches the Institute Counselling Service, nothing about it will go on his record.
Does it work for everybody?
No, but it seems to offer at least some help to the majority so is worth a try.
Is counselling like psychiatry?
Counselling bears little relation to psychiatry except that both deal with emotional and mental processes. Psychiatrist are trained doctors, who work largely through diagnosis of illness and then by prescribing a treatment - usually involving medication. Counsellors are normally non-medical personnel who work by talking and encouraging you to find your own solutions. Counsellors can however recognize the symptoms of severe mental distress, and may suggest you to consider medical help if seems appropriate.
Can I seek advice regarding a friend or colleague?
If you want to approach us regarding a friend, you are most welcome. We'll try our best to help you in helping your friend.

Academic Help
What exactly is a remedial class?
Remedial Classes are meant to clarify the basic concepts. It is possible that all intricacies and details as taught by the professor are not taught. However the underlying concepts are fully covered in a much simpler manner, on the basis of which further study can be done.
Oh great! So its okay if I don't attend lectures. right?
No, the remedial class are just a help provided when there is difficulty in grasping the concepts in college lectures. They may not cover the entire syllabus(only the difficult parts) and are sometimes not as regular as college lectures.
When can I approach the mentor?
Anytime, when the mentor is free. It depends on mutual understanding between the mentor and student. The mentor can be contacted via phone or other means, and unless he is in the middle of something very important, he is willing to help out.
Only weak students attend remedial classes...
Not at all! It is always possible to miss out on certain concepts while in class or during self study and the academic load may make us all feel pressurized at times. Therefore, asking for help doesn't undermine your intelligence or your capabilities, but only demonstrates your willingness to learn.
